# 🚧 Automated Vehicle Barrier System (AI + IoT)

An AI-powered access control system that combines Computer Vision and IoT to automate vehicle entry using real-time license plate recognition and Arduino-based barrier control.

---

## 📌 Overview

The Automated Vehicle Barrier System (AVBS) is an intelligent infrastructure solution designed to automate vehicle access in gated environments. 

The system integrates:
- YOLO-based vehicle detection
- OCR-based license plate recognition
- Flask backend server
- MySQL database logging
- Arduino-controlled physical barrier

This project demonstrates full-stack AI integration with embedded systems.

## 🧠 Key Capabilities

✔ Real-time vehicle detection  
✔ License plate extraction and recognition  
✔ Entry logging with timestamps  
✔ Decision-based barrier activation  
✔ Serial communication with Arduino  
✔ Live dashboard monitoring

## 🔌 IoT Integration

The backend communicates with an Arduino microcontroller via serial communication.

Workflow:
1. License plate is detected and processed
2. Access decision is made
3. Python sends control signal via serial port
4. Arduino activates servo/motor to lift barrier
